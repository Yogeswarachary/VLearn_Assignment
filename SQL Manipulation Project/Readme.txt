Problem Statement: 
TechSphere Solutions faces challenges in consolidating and analyzing employee-related data stored 
across multiple Excel files. The current manual process of extracting insights is inefficient, prone to 
errors, and incapable of handling the increasing volume of data. Specific pain points include:

1. Scattered Data:
- Employee details, project assignments, attendance records, and training program data exist in separate files without a unified key. 
2. Training Effectiveness: 
- No systematic method to evaluate the impact of training programs on employee or departmental performance. 
3. Operational Inefficiency: 
4. Budget Utilization: 
- Lack of insights into attendance patterns, project resource allocation, and employee contributions.
