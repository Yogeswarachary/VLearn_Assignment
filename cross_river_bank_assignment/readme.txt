# _Fraud Detection and Risk Analysis in Cross River Bank_ ðŸš€

### **Objective**

#### To analyze structured and unstructured data independently to identify loan fraud, assess customer 
risk, and understand customer behavior. This case study focuses on the loan and transaction data 
of Cross River Bank, leveraging MySQL and MongoDB for a comprehensive analysis.

### __Problem Statement__

Cross River Bank, a U.S.-based financial institution, faces challenges in detecting fraudulent 
activities and assessing customer risk effectively. With an increasing volume of loans and 
transactions, traditional manual methods are insufficient. The bank requires an automated system 
to analyze both structured data (e.g., customer, loan, and transaction data) and unstructured data 
(e.g., customer feedback, behavior logs) to identify patterns of fraud, optimize lending policies, and 
improve customer satisfaction.
